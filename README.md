### Hi, I am Niya! ðŸ‘‹ My friends also call me Nala or Nalan.

âœ¨I am a Localization Professional with academic background in environmental science and engineering. A year ago, I got inspired by a friend and started my journey with SoftUni, eventually realizing a dream: Learning to program! And since then, I have loved it! I am looking forward to start a career as a software engineer, working with and learning in new teams and collaborating in interesting projects.âœ¨

- ðŸ”­ I recently completed the Python - Django ORM and HTML, CSS courses at SoftUni.
- ðŸŒ± Currently I am learning JS Front-End. I'm looking forward to take the Python Web module in the program and eventually creating some interesting projects.

- âš¡ Fun fact: When I decided to have a break from academia, one of my best instructors told me that I would get bored eventually and I would miss the challenge. But I knew by then, I was never planning to get bored, I was already looking for new challenges!
