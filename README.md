### Hi, I am Niya! ðŸ‘‹ My friends also call me Nalan.

âœ¨I am a Localization Professional with an academic background in Environmental Science and Engineering. Recently, I was inspired by a friend to begin my journey with SoftUni. It has since become a dream come true and Iâ€™ve been enjoying every moment!

ðŸ”­ I recently completed the Software Engineering - Python learning path at SoftUni.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently strengthening my Front-End skills, with a focus on JavaScript and TypeScript.

ðŸ“š Passionate about building responsive web apps and writing clean, maintainable code.

ðŸ’¡ Always exploring how things work under the hood â€” from language quirks to real-world project structure.
