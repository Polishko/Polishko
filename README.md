### Hi, I am Niya! 👋 My friends also call me Nalan.

✨ I recently started an exciting career as a Junior Software Engineer, following an academic background in Environmental Science and Engineering and experience as a localization professional.

Inspired by a long-time dream of learning programming, I made the leap and it has truly become a dream come true. I've been enjoying every moment!

I completed the Software Engineering - Python learning path at SoftUni, as well as EPAM's Front-End Fundamentals and Specialization Training programs, before embarking on my new path.

Currently, I'm deepening my Front-End skills, focusing on JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Angular.

I'm passionate about building responsive web applications and writing clean, maintainable code.

I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood - from programming fundamentals to real-world project structure.
