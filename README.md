### Hi, I am Niya! ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨I am a Localization Professional with academic background in environmental science and engineering. A year ago, I got inspired by a friend and started my journey with SoftUni, eventually realizing a dream: Learning to program! And since then, I have loved it! I am looking forward to start a career as a software engineer, working with and learning in new teams and collaborating in interesting projects.âœ¨

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning Python - ORM and Django at SoftUni.
- ðŸŒ± I am looking forward to take the upcoming SoftUni courses: HTML, CSS, JS Front-End and Python Web and then creating my own portfolio with interesting projects.

- âš¡ Fun fact: When I decided to have a break from academia, one of my best instructors told me that I would get bored eventually and I would be missing the challenge. But I think I knew by then, I was never planning to get bored, I was already looking for new challenges!
